# Tasks

List of ideas I collected to improve the ESPL toolchain over the next few months.

## Task Manager Setup

For easier handing of TODO items, you may want to use https://github.com/benjaminoakes/markdo which you can install simply by running `gem install markdo`.

Then run
```
export MARKDO_ROOT=.
export MARKDO_INBOX=tasks.md
```

in this directory.
